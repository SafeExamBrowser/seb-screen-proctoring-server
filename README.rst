SEB Screen Proctoring Service
======

About 
-----------------------------------

SEB Server Screen Proctoring Webservice (sps-webservice) is a subproject of the `SEB Server <https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-server>`_ project and
a new webservice component running beside the seb-server service to provide screen proctoring features
for SEB Server.

Together with the SEB Server Screen Proctoring Guiservice (sps-guiservice), this service, that fully integrates to SEB Server, allows to configure and apply screen proctoring for exams with the `Safe Exam Browser (SEB) <https://safeexambrowser.org>`_.

The Image below shows the two screen proctoring components, sps-webservice and sps-guiservice, together with SEB Server and SEB Client and how they interact with each-other. This shows also how a fully bundled of SEB Server setup since version 2.0, would look like.
